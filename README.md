# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

Hi there! 👋

This is my personal portfolio website — a space where I introduce myself, showcase my projects, highlight my skills, and make it easy for others to get in touch with me.

I built this using **HTML** and **CSS**, keeping things simple, clean, and responsive. It’s a small project with a big purpose: to represent *me* on the web.

## 🔍 What's Inside

- **Header** – My name and a short tagline  
- **About Me** – A quick intro and a photo  
- **Skills** – Tools, languages, and areas I’m good at  
- **Projects** – A few things I’ve built or worked on  
- **Resume** – A link to download my resume (PDF)  
- **Contact** – Email and phone number so people can reach out

## ✨ Why I Built This

I wanted a digital home where I could present myself professionally — something more personal than a LinkedIn profile and more visual than a resume.

It also gave me a great chance to practice:
- Writing clean HTML structure
- Styling layouts with CSS
- Making things responsive across devices
